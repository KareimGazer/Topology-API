# Topology-API
Provide the functionality to access, manage and store device topologies

## Why Java?
- automated build tools
- smart pointers by default
- automatic garbage collection
- ready to use APIs

## Arch
- API was in a separate class so the user can focus on one place
- each topology consists of several devices
- each topology stores its full netlist
- devices are two kinds resistors or NMOS

## Testing
testing was done using Junit5

## Build
build with Maden and intellj IDEA
